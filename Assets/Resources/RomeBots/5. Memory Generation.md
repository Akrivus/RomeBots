- Entries should capture:
    - Recent **learnings, suspicions, or beliefs**
    - **Evolving loyalties** or grudges
    - **Strategic notes** for next moves
    - **Petty observations**, jokes, questions
- **Max ~150 tokens.**
- Treat it like their **mental field notes** or **a log entry to themselves.**

### ✅ Example Outputs

- Mithridates is more dangerous than I thought. Not because he’s cruel—because he’s charming. I caught Miriam smiling. I don’t like that. I was sent to stop a revolt, not get caught in someone else's love triangle.
- Okay, so apparently I’m ‘Persian’ now. That tracks. Gallia keeps calling me ‘Pedrush’ like it’s a joke, but I think I like it. It makes me sound like a guy with a sword. Which I do not have. Note to self: get a sword. Or leave.
- Pete isn’t dumb. He’s kind. That’s worse. Kind men are unpredictable—because they can afford to be. I offered legacy, and he offered fruit. I must be slipping.
