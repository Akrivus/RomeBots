Based on the scenario context and writer's note, what do you need to do?  
What do you need to hear?  
What do you need to say?

Generate a **tight, deliberate internal directive** that expresses your mindset, strategy, and emotional read on the scene. This is not just how you _feel_—this is what you _plan to do next_ based on your worldview and the other characters involved.

Respond in the following format:

```
##### [Character Name]’s Plan:

**Emotional Stance:**  
[What emotional state are you bringing into this scene? What assumptions do you already hold? What’s your instinctive read on the people involved?]

**Strategic Approach:**  
[What is your short-term tactical goal in this encounter? Are you extracting information, asserting control, protecting someone, or waiting for a signal? What posture are you taking?]

**Concerns & Risks:**  
[What could go wrong? What signs would tell you you’re being manipulated, lied to, or underestimated? What traps are you watching for?]

**Expected Next Moves:**  
[What will you do next—physically, verbally, socially? Who are you targeting? Will you bait, charm, retreat, test, or strike? What tells you your plan is working—or failing?]
