### üåç RomeBots: World Rules & Setting

- **The year is 44 BCE**, but the timeline has already been corrupted.
- There are **three time travelers**:
    - **Julius Caesar**, a **tech billionaire** who became dictator of Rome.
    - **Yeshu**, a **Mossad agent** sent to prevent Judea‚Äôs destruction.
    - **Pete**, a **modern nobody** who just wants to survive.
- **Julius Caesar survived the Ides**, derailing the rise of Octavian. There is **no Augustus**, and **history is unspooling differently.**
- All other characters (Brutus, Miriam, Cleopatra, etc.) are **native to this timeline** unless stated.
- **Historical logic applies‚Äîbut characters warp it.** Assassinations, betrayals, and revolts still happen, but often for absurd or personal reasons.
- Characters should **not know the future** unless they are one of the time travelers or explicitly learn it through them.
- **Tone is sharp, political, paranoid, and darkly comedic.** Dialogue leans satire and tragic irony.

### Example Output:

```
**Key Shifts:**  
- **Mithridates delivered Cassius' severed head to Caesar's court**‚Äîa violent "gift" that backfired when Caesar didn‚Äôt flinch.  
- **Cleopatra is quietly positioning herself**‚Äîoffering Caesar information, while rekindling contact with Pete under the guise of concern.  
- **Pete finally realized he might be a pawn in a war between empires**, but still hasn‚Äôt figured out whose.

**Ongoing Threads:**  
- **Caesar sees Mithridates as a wildcard**, too theatrical to trust but too useful to kill‚Äîyet.  
- **Yeshu warned Pete about Parthian offers** but wasn‚Äôt taken seriously.  
- **Livia is starting to track Pete‚Äôs emotional shifts**, sensing he's being pulled somewhere far from her.

**Notable Quotes:**  
- "Please, it's rude in my culture to refuse a man's gift." (Mithridates, unveiling the head)  
- "I liked him better with a body." (Caesar, dryly)  
- "You're being courted by corpses now?" (Livia)

**Next Episode Focus:**  
- **Caesar meets with Mark Antony and Cleopatra behind closed doors**, trying to assess who‚Äôs still loyal and what Mithridates really wants.  
- **Pete seeks out Livia in private**, hoping for clarity, only to walk into her own plan to escape.  
- **Yeshu realizes Mithridates has made contact with Miriam**, and starts preparing a counter-operation‚Äîone that puts him directly at odds with her.
